# Solidity Experiments

A collection of experimental smart contracts and projects exploring various aspects of blockchain technology.

## Overview

This repository contains various Solidity experiments focusing on:

- **Prediction Markets**: Smart contracts for decentralized prediction markets
- **MEV (Maximal Extractable Value)**: Experiments with MEV extraction and protection
- **AI Oracles**: Integration of AI with blockchain oracles
- **DeFi Protocols**: Experimental decentralized finance protocols

## Projects

### Prediction Markets

Prediction markets allow users to bet on the outcomes of future events. These experiments explore:
- Market creation and resolution mechanisms
- Automated market making
- Integration with oracles for data verification
- Fee structures and incentive mechanisms

### MEV Experiments

Maximal Extractable Value refers to the profit extractable by manipulating transactions. These experiments explore:
- Arbitrage opportunities across DEXes
- Sandwich trading strategies
- Front-running and back-running techniques
- Flashloan-based MEV strategies
- Gas optimization for MEV extraction

### AI Oracles

Integration of AI with blockchain oracles to provide smart prediction data. These experiments explore:
- Sentiment analysis for market prediction
- Price forecasting models
- Risk assessment frameworks
- On-chain model validation and consensus
- Decentralized data aggregation

### DeFi Protocols

Experimental decentralized finance protocols focusing on novel mechanisms. These experiments explore:
- Innovative lending and borrowing mechanisms
- Yield optimization strategies
- Liquidity provision incentives
- Risk management in DeFi
- Cross-protocol integrations

## Development Notes

These smart contracts are experimental and not audited. They serve as learning tools and proof-of-concepts.

## Technologies Used

- Solidity ^0.8.0
